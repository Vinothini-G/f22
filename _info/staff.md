## Course instructor: Diba Mirza

* Email: Please use Piazza rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Piazza to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (diba@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.


## Course TAs

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours).

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.

## Alex Mei, TA

Hi everyone! My name is Nawel, and I am a first year Ph.D. student in the CS department at UCSB. I graduated with an Engineering/Master's degree from the National School of Computer Science in my hometown of Algiers - Algeria. I then moved to Japan to pursue my second Master's at the University of Tokyo, before joining Hitachi, Ltd. as a researcher.  During the 5 years I spent in the corporate world, I had the chance to work on very different projects, ranging from networking protocol development, to renewable energy systems design. That's our privilege as computer scientists: wherever there is some sort of computation/data involved (which in this day and age is everywhere!), we can have a role to play, and a contribution to make. For my Ph.D. I am planning to focus on networking technologies, as I believe efficient and reliable communication is the lifeline of modern societies. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about any of the above themes, and of course, about C++ development. I'm excited to be part of the CS 16 staff, and I look forward to working with you all!

 Hello dear students! My name is Arthur, and I will be your ULA this quarter. CS16 was the first course I took at UCSB three years ago, so I'm nostalgic and also exteremely sympathetic towards you who get to experience this course and learn the basics of C++ for the first time. I will do my best to make sure you have a good experience in this class. Feel free to come for any help or chat about anything that interests you.
